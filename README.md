# Provider Dashboard

## Business Explanation

The Provider Dashboard is a web application designed for healthcare providers to efficiently manage administrative and clinical workflows. It streamlines processes such as prior authorization requests, additional documentation requests (ADR), support ticket management, and peer-to-peer communications. By centralizing these functions, the dashboard reduces administrative burden, improves compliance, and enhances the overall experience for providers and their staff. The platform integrates with payer systems and supports secure document uploads, real-time activity tracking, and robust support features, enabling providers to focus more on patient care and less on paperwork.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
